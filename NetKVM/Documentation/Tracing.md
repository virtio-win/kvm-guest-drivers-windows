# NetKVM Tracing #

NetKVM supports both "WPP" tracing and "kdprint" tracing. By default the WPP
tracing is enabled and can be viewed using TraceView as documented below. "kdprint"
tracing can be viewed by using Dbgview.

Viewing WPP tracing

* By default, TraceView.exe is located in the tools\tracing\<Platform> subdirectory
  of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), where <Platform> is either i386, amd64, or ia64.
* Run TraceView.exe as Administrator and Choose "File"->"Create New Log Session".
* Click "Add Provider" and from the Windows that shows up choose PDB, provide
  the suitable pdb file and click "OK".
* Click "Next" twice and the session should be started.

Choosing Tracing Level

This can be easily done from the driver's advanced tab in device manager by
choosing the desired level for Logging.Level. This configuration holds for both
"WPP" and "kdprint"

Disabling WPP tracing

Disabling the WPP tracing and using plain "kdprint" can be done by simply commenting
"#define NETKVM_WPP_ENABLED" from the Trace.h file.

* Note that in NetKVM WPP is supported only from Win7 and higher

## Viewing the WPP trace messages in real-time ##

1. Copy the driver's PDB file from the build folder to the target machine.
2. Copy **traceview.exe** from WDK install location on the build machine (C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Tools\x64\traceview.exe) to the target machine.
3. Start traceview as an Administrator.
4. On the **File** menu, click **Create New Log Session**.
5. Click **Add Provider**.
6. Click **PDB (Debug Information) File**, and then choose the .pdb file which came with the driver's build, in the build's folder.
7. Click Next.
8. Enter **Log Session Name**, as you like.
9. To save captured traces to a file, check the **Log Trace Event Data To File** option and set the file name, as you like.
10. Click the **>>** to the right of **Set Flags and Level**.
11. Put the right values, follow the "Obtaining the providers control GUID, enabled flags and level" section.

## Obtaining the providers control GUID enabled flags and level ##

1. Copy the script located in "Tools/getpdbinfo.bat" to any empty folder.
2. Copy **tracepdb.exe** from WDK install location on the build machine (C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64\tracepdb.exe) to the same folder.
3. Copy the .pdb file which comes with the driver's build to the scripts directory.
4. Open a command window and run, (Change pdbFile to your .pdb file name):
```
getpdbinfo.bat pdbFile
```
5. Read the following to understand how to determine which information is relevant :
   - **Control GUID** value
     The script copies it to the clipboard with braces added.
   - **EnableFlags** value
     Provider-defined value that specifies the class of events for which the provider generates events.
     The value is a 32bit binary word, each bit resembles a flag, each flag has a value and this value is a 32bit word as a hex number in which only 1 bit is on and its the bit's index which resembles the flag, if you pay attention to the .tmc file content you can see the flags and their values.
     In order to enable flags just turn on the bit with the right index in the 32bit word, when done, convert the 32bit word to a hexadecimal number. (its recommended to enable all flags!)
   - **EnableLevel** value
     Provider-defined value that specifies the level of detail included in the event.
     Putting the value to 6, includes all the important message levels.

## How to enable WPP tracing for a component at boot time ##

The AutoLogger session is used to capture traces before the user logs in.

### Configuring an autologger session ###

#### Using the tracelog.exe ####

1. Copy **tracelog.exe** from WDK install location on the build machine (C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64\tracelog.exe) to the target pc's (C:\Windows\System32) folder.
2. Go to https://www.guidgenerator.com/ and generate a GUID for the logger session.
3. Open any text editor and copy this command line:
```
tracelog -addautologger [LoggerSessionName] -sessionguid #GeneratedGUID -flag Flag -level Level -guid #ProvidersControlGUID
```
4. Change the _[LoggerSessionName]_ to the desired session's name.
5. Change the value of _GeneratedGUID_ to our generated guid accordingly, keep the #.
6. Change the rest of the values: _Flag_, _Level_ and _ProvidersControlGUID_, keep the #, follow the "Obtaining the providers control GUID, enabled flags and level" section.
7. Once done, run the command line with cmd, (as an administrator).
8. Reboot the target pc for the changes to take effect.

#### **manually** Using the registry ####

1. Run regedit.
2. Navigate to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger".
3. Under the "Autologger" key create a key for the AutoLogger session that you want to configure and rename it to the desired session's name.
   - Go to https://www.guidgenerator.com/ and generate a GUID with the braces option enabled, this is for the logger session.
   - Add a new "String Value" to the key and rename it to "GUID", put the generated GUID as the value.
   - Add a new "DWORD Value" to the key and rename it to "Start", put 1 in the value.
   - NOTE: you can add more values to better configure the session refer to: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363687.aspx
4. Under the session's key create a key for our provider that you want to enable to the session. Use the driver's provider control GUID as the name of the key. (explained below!)
   - Add a new "DWORD Value" to the key and rename it to "Enabled", put 1 in the value.
   - Add a new "DWORD Value" to the key and rename it to "EnableFlags", put in the enabled flags hex value, follow the "Obtaining the providers control GUID, enabled flags and level" section.
   - Add a new "DWORD Value" to the key and rename it to "EnableLevel", put 6 in the value, follow the "Obtaining the providers control GUID, enabled flags and level" section.
   - NOTE: you can add more values to better configure the provider refer to: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363687.aspx
5. Reboot the target pc for the changes to take effect.

Now, with every boot or shutdown the logger is going to create a .etl trace log file to "..\Windows\System32\LogFiles\WMI\<session'sname>.etl".

## Reading .etl log files using TraceView ##

1. Copy **traceview.exe** from WDK install location on the build machine (C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Tools\x64\traceview.exe) to the target machine.
2. Start traceview as an Administrator.
3. On the **File** menu, click **Open Existing Log File**.
4. In the **Log File Name** box, choose the .etl file you want to read.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Click **PDB (Debug Information) File** and then choose the .pdb file which came with the driver's build, in the build's folder.
7. Click **OK**.
